# huomata

An open-source cross-platform PDF reader with built-in [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) annotations

---

Welcome to *huomata*!

The team at [Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/) has built a functional PDF reader for your browser: [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js).
In conjunction with hypothes.is (GH: [hypothesis/h](https://github.com/hypothesis/h)), you have a powerful tool for annotating your PDFs, which is particularly useful for academics and researchers.
However, launching a browser tab every time you want to read and annotate a PDF can be overkill.
*Huomata* simplifies matters: built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) (GH: [atom/electron](https://github.com/atom/electron)), it gives you a near-native, cross-platform, desktop experience for browsing your PDFs along with built-in support for hypothes.is.
